# Bug Tracker
Usually each software and product company develops a software and they keep improve their Application to generate more revenue. To ensure quality of web application they internally verify their application functionality from QA, and what QA job is to either file a bug or raise a new ticket which has enhancements/feature. For the same most of the company uses bug tracking tools like Jira, BugZilla, lime, etc. 

So in this repository you will see I made a try to replicate bug tracking tool, it will keep track of currently running task. I'll keep improving this project in future. If you're interested please fork and feel free to provide me feedback / suggestions. I'm happy to hear from you 

:) Happy Coding :)
